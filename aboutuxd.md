Who we are
----------

Red Hat’s User Experience Design (UXD) Team is a multi-disciplinary group of product designers, UX researchers, UI engineers, and content designers within Red Hat’s Engineering organization who work closely with product teams to create desirable & accessible solutions that improve peoples’ lives.

For Red Hatters, [this slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FrLjj6hHKCz_HNUIla8SEqSiDsD8ASqyyPOOUpetnzc/edit#slide=id.g7faf587674_0_2114) includes more information about our internal reporting structure.

What we do
----------

Through [research](https://www.uxd-hub.com/entries/resource/about-user-research), we help teams deeply understand the needs of our users through analytics and user research to influence the direction of our products.

[Product design](https://www.uxd-hub.com/entries/resource/about-product-design) partners closely with engineers, business leaders, and others to design solutions that address those user needs and make powerful technologies more accessible.

Our [content designers](https://www.uxd-hub.com/entries/resource/about-content-design) help guide users through our products and easily understand the information they need to make informed decisions without mistakes.

[Front-end development](https://www.uxd-hub.com/entries/resource/about-front-end-development) continuously helps to ensure accessibility and a consistent experience across all of our products and services through development and maintenance of [PatternFly](https://www.uxd-hub.com/entries/resource/patternfly), Red Hat's open source design system.

Our Vision
----------

Our team aspires to be an open, collaborative leader in the creation of data-informed and desirable experiences that makes powerful technology accessible across Red Hat.

After many years of helping teams build highly-usable and accessible solutions, we’re increasingly focused on helping them quickly identify the _right_ solutions to build through discovery research to ensure that we help users achieve the outcomes they care about most.

We established this vision together in 2023 through a highly-collaborative and research-driven process that Red Hatters can read about [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eLRMwiU3ygcyUGacv7dHu6-njIm6vU2YulCJ2wZIVeg/edit#slide=id.g107d352c886_0_52).

Our values
----------

As Red Hatters we always try to practice the core [Red Hat values](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/brand/standards/culture) of freedom, courage, commitment, and accountability, but we also have a set that’s specific to our team:

**Design openly** 

We design and collaborate openly. We are honest and forthcoming, but also considerate. We actively seek the perspective of others to amplify and improve our contributions. We help our teammates do the same by providing respectful feedback.

**Offer generously** 

We are generous with our time, resources, knowledge, and appreciation. We are supportive and look out for each other. 

**Nurture curiosity** 

We are lifelong learners. We investigate ideas and find lessons in our mistakes. We are the stewards of our own careers, and to that end, we pursue our passions and develop ourselves.

**Cultivate community**

We believe in the value of community and seek solutions that transcend our immediate project needs.

Our methods
-----------

We strive to take a data-driven approach to all of our work. Great design comes from an understanding of user needs and desired outcomes along with a commitment to iterate and continually make the experience better.

Our [Methods library](https://www.uxd-hub.com/areas/methods) contains a set of tools and techniques for discovery, ideation, and evaluation of designs. Each method provides a unique take on how user insights can be used to inform design decisions. [Learn more and get started using our Methods library](https://www.uxd-hub.com/entries/method/where-to-start).
